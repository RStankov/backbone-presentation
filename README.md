Backbone.js presentation
------------------------

This is my backbone presentation at [init Lab](http://initlab.org/) on 23.06.2012. It was part of [SofiaJs User group](http://sofiajs.org/) meet up.

The repo contains the presentation in keynote and pdf formats. Plus the source code of the 4 demos I gave.
